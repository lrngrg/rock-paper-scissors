Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).


PLAYER SELECT
Ask player to choose rock, paper, or scissors;
If the answer is not rock, paper, or scissors, ask again;
Convert their answer to lowercase and store it in playerSelection;

COMPUTER SELECT
Create a list that contains: rock, paper, scissors;
Randomly generate a number between 1 and 3 (or 0 & 2) to correspond with position in list;
Store the choice that occupies that list position in computerSelection;

COMPARE THE TWO SELECTIONS 
Create an empty string;
If playerSelection === computerSelection, it's a tie (add "It's a tie!" to string);
If playerSelection === rock and computerSelection === paper, they lose (add "You Lose! Paper beats Rock!" to string);
If playerSelection === rock and computerSelection === scissors, they win (add "You Win! Rock beats Scissors!" to string);
If playerSelection === paper and computerSelection === rock, they win (add "You Win! Paper beats Rock!" to string);
If playerSelection === paper and computerSelection === scissors, they lose (add "You Lose!  Scissors beats Paper!" to string);
If playerSelection === scissors and computerSelection === paper, they win (add "You Win! Scissors beats Paper!");
If playerSelection === scissors and computerSelection === rock, they lose (add "You Lose! Rock beats Scissors!");

DECLARE RESULTS
Return the string telling the player the game results.

Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.


Begin a round number counter at 0.
Add 1 everytime a round of the game is played, until you reach 5 games.
Create two counters, one for the player, one for the computer, that begin at 0.
