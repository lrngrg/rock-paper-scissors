Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
Make your functionâ€™s playerSelection parameter case-insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).


PLAYER SELECT
Ask player to choose rock, paper, or scissors;
If the answer is not rock, paper, or scissors, ask again;
Convert their answer to lowercase and store it in playerSelection;

COMPUTER SELECT
Create a list that contains: rock, paper, scissors;
Randomly generate a number between 1 and 3 (or 0 & 2) to correspond with position in list;
Store the choice that occupies that list position in computerSelection;

COMPARE THE TWO SELECTIONS 
Create an empty string;
If playerSelection === computerSelection, it's a tie (add "It's a tie!" to string);
If playerSelection === rock and computerSelection === paper, they lose (add "You Lose! Paper beats Rock!" to string);
If playerSelection === rock and computerSelection === scissors, they win (add "You Win! Rock beats Scissors!" to string);
If playerSelection === paper and computerSelection === rock, they win (add "You Win! Paper beats Rock!" to string);
If playerSelection === paper and computerSelection === scissors, they lose (add "You Lose!  Scissors beats Paper!" to string);
If playerSelection === scissors and computerSelection === paper, they win (add "You Win! Scissors beats Paper!");
If playerSelection === scissors and computerSelection === rock, they lose (add "You Lose! Rock beats Scissors!");

DECLARE RESULTS
Return the string telling the player the game results.

Write a NEW function called game(). Call the playRound function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.


Begin a counter at 0.
Add 1 everytime a round of the game is played, until you reach 5 games.
Create two counters, one for the player, one for the computer.
At the end of each round, increment the respective counter by 1 of whoever won.

^^Each round should be played as above.^^

After the 5th round, compare to see who has the greater number of wins.
If the player has less than the computer, they lose.
If the player has more than the computer, they win.

GET COMPUTER'S CHOICE

function getComputerChoice() {
    let weaponList = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors'];
    let weaponChoice = weaponList[Math.floor(Math.random() * weaponList.length)];
    return weaponChoice;
}
console.log(getComputerChoice())


//////

GET PLAYERS SELECTION

playerSelection = prompt("Rock, Paper, or Scissors?").toLowerCase();
    while (playerSelection !== 'rock' && playerSelection !== 'paper' && playerSelection !== 'scissors') {
        playerSelection = prompt("Choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors!").toLowerCase();
    }
console.log(playerSelection);
